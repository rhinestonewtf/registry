## Intro

Account abstraction (or smart accounts) will deliver three key enhancements for the Ethereum ecosystem;
improved UX, enhanced user security and greater wallet extensibility. Modular smart accounts are the next
frontier for supercharging these deliverables. However, it also opens up a number of new challenges that
could drastically undermine the objective by opening up a plethora of new attack vectors and security concerns for accounts.

The [Rhinestone Registry] aims to solve this concern by providing a means of verifying the legitimacy and
security of independently built smart account modules for deployment and use across any integrated
smart account. [Rhinestone Registry] is a free, open and permissionless registry and verifications
system for smart account modules on the Ethereum platform. With an emphasis on contract security and
transparency, it allows attesters to register, verify, and dispatch verification statuses across
various EVM chains.

## Core Principles

### Attestations

[Attestations](./docs/Attestation.md) represent digitally documented assertions made by any entity
about the security poture of account abstraction modules,
serving as a seal of authenticity for the associated data. An entity known as an
Attestor forms these records, authenticating them with their Ethereum wallet
and then registering them on the Ethereum blockchain. The accessibility of
these attestations for verification is universal, provided one has access
to the Ethereum blockchain and the unique UID of the attestation.

An attestation consists of two primary elements: the schema and the
attestation data. The schema acts as a standardized structure for
creating and validating attestations, defining the data types,
format, and composition. The Rhinestone Registry uses Solidity
ABI types as acceptable fields in these schemas. The attestation
data represents the actual information subject to attestation.
To be classified as a valid attestation, it should adhere to the
structure defined in the schema.

The significance of attestations lies in their ability to
facilitate trust and credibility within the blockchain. In
scenarios lacking physical interaction or presence, verifying
the veracity or reliability of information can be demanding.
Attestations address this challenge by providing third-party
validation and a cryptographically signed confirmation of
information authenticity, thus enhancing the information's
trustworthiness for others.

### Schemas

[Schemas](./docs/Schema.md) represent predefined structures utilized for the formation and
verification of attestations. They define the data types, format, and
composition of an attestation. The Rhinestone Registry accepts Solidity
ABI types as acceptable fields for schemas. Schemas play an essential
role as they establish a shared format and structure for attestation
data, enabling the creation and verification of various attestations
in a trustless fashion. This functionality paves the way for
interoperability and composability amongst different attestation protocols and solutions.

### Attestors

Attestors refer to individuals or organizations responsible for
creating and signing attestations. They add the attestation to the
Ethereum blockchain, making it available for verification. Any
individual owning an Ethereum wallet can become an Attestor and
can formulate attestations for a variety of purposes.

### Modules

Modules are smart contracts that act as modular components that can be added to smart accounts.
The registry is agnostic towards smart account or module implementations. Modules addresses and
deployment metadata are stored on the registry.

Modules are registered on the Rhinestone Registry by [deploying](./docs/ModulesRegistration.md) the Module Bytecode with `CREATE2`

### Cross-Chain Consistency

For account abstraction modules that can be used [across multiple Ethereum](./docs/L2Propagation.md) chains,
the Rhinestone Registry can ensure the consistency of modules across these chains.
This feature will prevent versioning issues, guaranteeing that users experience the same level of security and functionality,
irrespective of the chain they're on.

### Users

Users represent entities that depend on attestations to inform
decisions or initiate actions. They utilize the information enclosed
within the attestation to confirm its authenticity and integrity. The
backing for these attestations often lies in the reputation and
trustworthiness of the Attestor.

### Ethereum ABI Types

The Ethereum Application Binary Interface (ABI) stipulates the data
types that can be incorporated in smart contracts and other Ethereum transactions.
EAS accepts ABI types as valid fields for schemas.

## Architecture

The Rhinestone Registry is designed as a permissionless hyperstructure.
This architecture enables the registry to effectively manage and coordinate various types of smart contracts,
spanning multiple developers and authorities. With this level of interconnectedness, smart contracts can freely interact with each other and with
various authorities, opening up a world of possibilities for rich, complex interactions. It promotes a decentralized, collaborative environment,
where entities can share, validate, and verify smart contracts across chains.

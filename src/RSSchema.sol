/**
 * @title RSSchema
 *
 * @dev The RSSchema contract serves as a crucial component of a broader system for managing "schemas" within a
 * blockchain ecosystem. It provides functionality to register, retrieve and manage schemas. This contract is a
 * concrete implementation of the IRSSchema interface.
 *
 * @dev A schema in this context is a defined structure that represents a record for a submitted schema,
 * encompassing its unique identifier (UID), resolver (optional), revocability status, specification, owner's address,
 * and associated bridges for Layer 2 (L2) propagation.
 *
 * @dev The main functionality of the RSSchema contract includes the registration of new schemas (`registerSchema` function)
 * and the retrieval of existing schemas (`getSchema` function). It also offers additional management features such as
 * setting bridges (`setBridges` function) and resolvers (`setResolver` function) for each schema.
 *
 * @dev Each new schema is registered with a UID that is calculated based on its data members using the `_getUID` function.
 * This UID is used as a key to map the schema record in the `_schemas` mapping. The system ensures uniqueness of the schemas
 * by validating that a schema with the same UID does not already exist.
 *
 * @dev Furthermore, the RSSchema contract introduces access control by ensuring that certain operations such as setting
 * bridges and resolvers can only be performed by the owner of the schema.
 *
 * @dev In summary, the RSSchema contract is an integral part of a larger system, providing the functionality to register,
 * retrieve, and manage schemas in a controlled and structured manner.

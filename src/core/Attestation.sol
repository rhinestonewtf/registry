/**
 *  Abstract contract that implements the `IRegistry` interface
 *
 *  Attestations on the Registry represent statements about Modules.
 *  An Attestation is made using a particular Schema that is used to encode and decode the Attestation data.
 *  The most important usecase for Attestations is to make statements about the security of a Module.
 *
 * ## Attestation Lifecycle
 *
 *  When an Attester creates an Attestation, the Attestation data, structured according to the Schema provided
 *  by the Attester, is then added to the Registry. During the Attestation's lifecycle, the Registry can invoke
 *  hooks on the SchemaResolver during specific events like Attestation creation and revocation.
 *  This allows the SchemaResolver to ensure the integrity and correctness of the attestation throughout
 *  its lifecycle.
 *
 *  ### AttestationRequest
 *  data is `abi.encode()` according to a defined schema. The data is not stored in the storage of thr Registry,
 *  but is rather stored with `SSTORE2` to save gas and a pointer to this data is stored on the Registry.
 *
 * ![Sequence Diagram](public/docs/attestationOnly.svg)
 *
 * ### Interactions with the SchemaValidator
 *
 * Attestation data can be validated with an external contract than may to `abi.decode()` and validate all or specific fields.
 *
 * ### Interaction with the IExternalResolver
 *
 * Upon an Attestation's revocation, the Registry calls hooks on the associated IResolver, allowing the IResolver to
 * update its internal state or
 * perform other necessary actions. This allows for extended business logic integrations.
 *
 * ### The Revocation Process
 *
 * In the event that an Attester decides to revoke an Attestation, they issue a revocation call to the Registry.
 *  Upon receiving this call, the registry updates the revocationTime field within the attestation record.
 *  This timestamp acts as a clear indication that the attestation has been revoked, and any trust or claims
 *  that stem from it should be reconsidered.
 *
 * It's important to note that apart from the revocationTime, the rest of the attestation's metadata and data
 *  remains unchanged.
 * Due to the nature of `SSTORE2`, all attestation data will remain onchain and thus preserves the history of
 *  attestations done.
 *
 * ### Editing Attestions
 *
 * Attestations can not be edited. Should attestation data change, the old attestation must be revoked and a new attestation issued.
 *
 *
 * - A service opts to cover its users' Attestation costs (taking care of gas expenses)
 * - An entity wishes to execute multiple Attestations but allows the recipient or a different party to
 *  handle the transaction fees for blockchain integration.
 * Allows `msg.sender` to make attestations / revocations directly

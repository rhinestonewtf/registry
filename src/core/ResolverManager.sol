/**
 * Resolvers are external contracts that are tied to Modules and called when specific Registry actions are executed.
 * ## Resolver Hooks
 *
 * external Resolvers are called during:
 *
 * - attestation
 * - revocation
 * - module registration
 *
 * This architectural design aims to provide entities like Smart Account vendors or DAOs, with the
 * flexibility to incorporate custom business logic while maintaining the
 * robustness and security of the core functionalities implemented by the Registry.
 *
 * ## Role of Resolveres in extending Registry functionalities
 *
 * Entities utilizing the Registry frequently need to extend its core functionalities
 * to cater to their unique business requirements. Resolvers are the mechanisms that
 * make this possible, allowing for:
 *
 * - _Custom Business Logic Integration:_ Entities can build upon the foundational
 *   registry operations by introducing complex logic sequences, tailored to their
 *   operational needs.
 *
 * - _Security Assurance:_ One of the significant advantages of using resolvers is that
 *   they abstract away the intricacies of attestation storage and validation.
 *   This abstraction ensures that the foundational security of the Registry isn't compromised,
 *   even when new functionalities are added.
 *
 * - _Cost Efficiency in Audits:_ Given that the core attestation storage and validation
 *   logic remains untouched, auditing becomes more straightforward and cost-effective.
 *   Entities can focus their audit efforts on their custom logic without the need to
 *   re-audit the underlying core systems.
 *
 * ## The `IExternalResolver` interface: Standardizing Resolvers
 *
 * For any entity looking to employ a resolver, adherence to a standardized
 * interface is essential.
 * The [IExternalResolver interface](../../external/IExternalResolver.sol/interface.IExternalResolver.html) delineates the essential
 * functions a resolver must implement to ensure seamless integration and operation with the Registry.
 * @dev only `msg.sender` and the external `IExternalResolver` address are used to create a unique ID for the resolver
 *    This allows for a single resolver address to be possible across different chains
